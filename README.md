# Gillespie-s-Algorithm-MATLAB

A repository to simulate kinesin and dynein states through stochastic differential equations.

Our MATLAB code uses Gillespie's Algorithm to simulate motor protein states. Primarily, we work with kinesin and dynein.

The manyGillespieInteracting file is the code which accounts for multiple proteins that may interact with eachother.

The single Gillespie file is a more naive approach.

If using this code, cite the paper:
